## üßë‚Äçüíª How Each Tech Is Used

- **MongoDB**: Simulated with `localStorage` (class-based, mirrors MongoDB queries)
- **Express.js**: Simulated via a `TaskAPI` service for RESTful routes
- **Angular**: Component-style separation for views & logic (modern JavaScript)
- **Node.js**: Uses JS classes, modules, async/await ‚Äî all runnable in browser


---

## üí° Project Highlights

- Clean, professional UX
- Separation of concerns (database, API, UI layers)
- Resume-ready full-stack demo ‚Äî discuss CRUD, RESTful APIs, responsive layout, component code, etc.
- Easily extendable to real database/server (swap localStorage with MongoDB, add Express server, split JS into Angular app)
